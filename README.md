As a research intern, I conducted a feasibility study on the performance of a U-tube geothermal heat exchanger system utilizing bentonite grouting. 

The system was modeled in ANSYS Fluent, where I developed a structured O-grid mesh to ensure simulation accuracy around the heat exchanger geometry. A series of CFD analyses were performed with varying soil temperature profiles as input parameters to evaluate the systemâ€™s thermal performance and determine the outlet temperature under different regional conditions.

Based on the simulation results, the study concluded that direct-use geothermal heat exchanger systems are significantly more feasible and effective in warmer southeastern provinces like British Columbia, while proving less suitable for colder northern territories and northwestern provinces such as Nova Scotia, due to lower ground temperatures affecting heat transfer efficiency.
